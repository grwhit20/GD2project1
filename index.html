    <h1><span class="highlight">Helvetica</span>, <span class="highlight">Modernism</span> and the <span class="highlight">Status Quo</span> of Design</h1>

    <h2>was a great reading to start out with. I'm happy you're exposing us to things which help build a more diverse world view as much of the research we've done in our first few years has been very Modernism-centric.</h2>

    <h3>I appreciated the authors points on Paul Rand and Vignelli as our professors certainly have done some glorifying of these figures, ignoring their vanilla opinions.</h3>

    <h4>I think it's absolutely paramount that the students at this school especially are exposed to information such as this</h4>

    <h5>as the MICA bubble also 'protects' the student body from cultural exposure,</h5>

    <p>which is a slippery slope.</p>
